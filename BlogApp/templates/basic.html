    <h5>About Python</h5>
    <div class="jumbotron">
        <b>
            Python </b> is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by <b>Guido van
            Rossum</b> and
        first released in 1991.
        <br>
        <br>
        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
        structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included"
        language due to its comprehensive standard library.

    <h5>Simple Python Rules</h5>
    <div class="jumbotron">
        <ol>
            <li> <b>
                    Python Identifiers </b></li>
            <p>A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
                </li>
                <li>Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.
                </li>
                <li>Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><b>
                    Lines and Indentation
                </b>
            </li>
            <p>Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.</p>

            <p>The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented
                the same amount.</p>
            <br>
            <li> <b>
                    Comments in Python </b></li>
            <p>A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment.</p>
            <p>Triple-quoted(''') string is also ignored by Python interpreter and can be used as a multiline comments.
            </p>

    <h5>Python Webdevelopment Frameworks

    </h5>
    <div class="jumbotron">Python is one of the most acceptable languages among web and application developers because
        of its strong emphasis on efficiency and readability. There are numerous outstanding Python web frameworks, each
        with their own specialities and features, such as <b>Django</b>,<b>Flask</b>,Web2py,Pyramid,Dash.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h6>Will talk about Django and Flask</h6>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>
                    Django
                </b>

            </li>
            <p>Django is based on MVT (Model View Template).Built by experienced developers, Django is a high level
                Python web framework which allows rapid, clean and pragmatic design development. Django handles much of
                the complexities of web development.

            </p>
            <p>It works with mostly all important databases like Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.</p>

            <li>
                <b>Flask</b>
            </li>
            <p>It is classified as a micro-framework as we donâ€™t require any particular libraries or tools.</p>
            <p>Flask support multiple extensions which extended the application features as if they were implemented in
                Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling etc..</p>
